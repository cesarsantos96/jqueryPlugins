# jqueryPlugins

    This is the repository for module 10 of the EBAC Full Stack course, where I'll be learning about jQuery and some other topics:

## Plugins:

    - hamburger menu
    - Image Carousel
    - Applying mask to text fields
    - Form validation
    - Creating a carousel

### Exercise:

    I created a registration form, this form should contain fields: full name, email, phone, CPF (Brazil id for individuals) and Zip code. I used the jQuery Mask plugin to apply a mask to the CPF and ZIP fields.
